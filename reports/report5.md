## Software Maintainability<a name="software_maintainability"></a>

The ease or difficulty with which a software system can be modified is known as maintainability. The maintainability of a software system is determined by properties of its source code.

**Short Units of Code** in order to be easier to understand.

**Simple Units of Code** makes it easier to modify and test.

**Code Written Once** avoids code and error multiplication. 

**Separate Concerns in Modules** identify and extract responsibilities of large modules to separate modules and hide implementation details behind interfaces. 

**Architecture Components Balanced** Balancing the number and relative size of components makes it easier to locate code.

**Couple Architecture Components Loosely** components makes it easier to maintain components in isolation.

**Automate Tests** Automating tests for your codebase makes development more predictable and less risky.

**Write Clean Code** Clean code is more maintainable.

**Codebase Small** maintainability slightly increases.

## Evolution Process<a name="evolution_process"></a>
The feature that was decided to implement was identified by the OpenRCT2 collaborators themselves, and marked as a possible improvement in the program for those who want to implement it.
The feature consistes in prevent the auto-save if the game is in pause and nothing has been done. This way, we prevent the creation of multiple slots with the same save.

For example, if in the game options is selected to save the game every 5 minutes, and at the minute 1, the game is paused (where nothing is being changed), the game is only saved automatically after 4th minute after resuming. In this way, the pause is not counted as time for the save and the time passed before the pause is counted to keep the logic of saving the game every 5 minutes.

The choice of this feature was made based on the time we had and how challenging it would be for us to implement it.  

**Briefly** describe how the feature you decided to evolve was identified, why did you decide to evolve that particular feature and how the parts in the source code that needed to be modified were located.
