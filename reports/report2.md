### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Requirements engineering (RE) is the process of studying custom/user expectations towards a specific product. In other words, requirements engineering means that requirements for a system are defined, managed and tested systematically.
These software requirements deals with establishing the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by software and fully describes what software will do and how it will be expected to perform.
Requirements must be quantifiable, detailed and not ambiguous.

Sempre que existam por parte de colaboradores, novas ideias para o projeto, a equipa aconselha a contacta-la primeiro, porque podem já existir planos para a sua realização, ou então, porque a equipa pode já ter motivos contra a sua implementação. Ao contactar a equipa, o colaborador evita perder tempo implementando uma feature que pode não ser aceite. É possível contactar a equipa através do [gitter](https://gitter.im/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2).
