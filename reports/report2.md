## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
### Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
Requirements are a detailed description of what features a software product should have. They're generally considered to be the first phase of software development.

Requirements are important because they are one of the key contributors to the success or failure of projects: if what is needed to be done isn't known, we might end up solving the wrong issue entirely.

If we plan software to be high-quality from the beginning, we have a greater chance of it staying that way rather than another product that doesn't have high-quality as a goal.

**Fig2 -** Cost of fixing errors depending on the phase of the project they were found ("Software Engineering Economics" book from *Barry Boehm*).

Researchers at big organizations have found that removing an error just before starting to code allows 10 to 100 times less costs than when it's done when testing the system or after release. [\[1\]](#reference1)

This cost can be explained very simply: if an error is found during the coding stage, it's easy to correct it by fixing a few lines. However, if the error has to do with the overall design of the system, it is much harder to solve, possibly requiring a rewrite of certain features, or even the entire project.

The time that should be spent on requirements highly depends on the project. If the requirements are stable, it will take less time than if they were unstable. The size of the project is also an important factor: for smaller projects you may be able to afford programming as you create the requirements, whereas that would be very risky in a larger project.

##### Requirements Elicitation Process in OpenRCT2
According to developers, OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything from the original Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, as well as many improvements and additional features. For example, some of these may include support for modern platforms, an improved interface, improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and cooperative multi player.

When any developer interested in OpenRCT2 has a new idea for the project, the development team recommends contacting them first, since they might already have plans for the same idea, or because the team might have issues against its implementation. By contacting the team, the developer avoids spending time on a feature that might not be accepted. The team can be contacted through [gitter](https://gitter.im/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2).

### Non-Functional requirements<a name="non-functional-requirements"></a>
#### User requirements<a name="non-functional-user-requirements"></a>
* The game must be optimized and, as a consequence, meet a set minimum number of frames per second.

#### System requirements<a name="non-functional-system-requirements"></a>
There are no hardware non-functional system requirements in OpenRCT2. However, the original requirements of this type for the original game were:
* **Processor (CPU):** Pentium III
* **System memory (RAM):** 64 MB
* **Hard disk drive(HDD):** 800MB
* **Video card (GPU):** 8 MB of VRAM, DirectX 8.1 compatible

In terms of operating system, however, OpenRCT2 is multi platform and must run in any of the 3 major operating systems (Windows, macOS and Linux).

## Use Cases<a name="use-cases"></a>
### Brief Definition
A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, and organize system requirements.
The use case is a list of actions or event steps, typically defining the interactions between a role,also know as actor, and a system to achieve a goal.

**Actor -** Actor models a type of role played by an entity, not an individual user of the system, that interacts with the system . Actors are external entities such as people or other systems that interfaces with the developed system.

**Development System -** The software made, it can be an application, a game,etc.

A use case (or set of use cases) has these characteristics:
* Organizes functional requirements.
* Models the goals of system/actor (user) interactions.
* Records paths (called scenarios) from trigger events to goals.
* Is multi-level, so that one use case can use the functionality of another one.

## Domain Model<a name="domain-model"></a>
### Brief Definition
In software engineering, a "domain model" may be seen as a conceptual model of a system that incorporates all its entities and their information, as well as the relations between them.
A "domain model" is, this way, a set of abstractions that help in understanding a given system and its activity.
