## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
 
## Logical View<a name="logical_view"></a>
In the context of our game, we consider packages into every division by code files folders.
According to the above mentioned, we consider that there is a link between one package and another if in the first package there are files that include files from the second package.

Due to the huge complexity of the OpenRCT2, thereâ€™s a big interconnection between its packages. The fact that the whole game has been reverse engineered from the original executable based on the assembly, makes it so that most part of the packages have a huge dependency on a great number of other packages.
## Development View<a name="development_view"></a>
   
## Deployment View<a name="deployment_view"></a>
A deployment view model allows us to understand the hardware and sotware needs of a program.
For OpenRTC2 the deployement model is very simple as it only needs a working computer for it to run. The deployment diagram for the game looks like this:

## Process View<a name="process_view"></a>
The Process view shows tasks and processes that the system has, interfaces to the outside world and/or between components within the system and focuses on the runtime behavior of the system. This model is represented by Activity diagram.

An **Activity diagram** is like a flowchart, as it shows the flow from one activity to another.
