# Software Processes in OpenRCT2

## Brief description
OpenRCT2 is an open source re-implementation of the RCT2 (RollerCoaster Tycoon 2) game. RCT2 is an amusement park construction and management simulation computer game.
It was started in 2014 by a single person, Ted "IntelOrca" John, with the intent of modernizing upon the original game as well as porting it to other operating systems.
At the time of writing, it has 142 contributors.
The core language is C and it was painfully reverse engineered from the original game executable.

## Development Process
### Initial development
Having its roots in the hands of a single person, it probably didn't start with a specific development process. However, it was reverse engineered from the original game executable in an interesting way: a single function was re-implemented from the executable at a time and, by use of regression testing against the original game, tested to make sure it does what it's supposed to do.

### Current development
Atualmente, existem diversos colaboradores para a evolução do projeto sendo que o fundador continua a ser o maior contribuidor. Os contribuidores juntam-se numa plataforma de chat para trocar ideias sobre o jogo em si e sobre os possíveis melhorias para o jogo.
Periodicamente, são lançadas versões do jogo com os vários updates feitos.

### Opinions, critics and alternatives
Por, inicialmente, o projeto ser de apenas uma pessoa, não existia necessidade de comentar o código em grande quantidade, sendo que atualmente, com o aumento dos colaboradores, este aspeto é uma desvantagem. Apenas 7% do código é comentado. Um alto número de comentários pode ser indicador de um código bem estruturado e organizado e, por sua vez, melhora a interpretação de toda a equipa de desenvolvimento.

According to the statistics, over the past twelve months, 130 developers contributed new code to OpenRCT2.So,that means the project is getting more and more interesting for open source community.Although, there isnt any project planning yet and makes it harder for new contributors since they dont know where exactly they should start by.
Also,having a decent planning leads to a significant increase of efficiency of everyone working on the project.But why? Well,highlighting the most important, we got the following:
* Coordination between contributors
* Good environment 
* Work getting tracked over time (such as progress,time cost,etc)
* Guide the work in order to know exactly what to do next
By now it should be clear why we must follow some planning.

TODO:
	Whether the project was started with the idea of making it by himself.
	Why the project was started.
	Is there any development process?
