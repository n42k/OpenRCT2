# Software Processes in OpenRCT2

## Brief description
OpenRCT2 is an open source re-implementation of the RCT2 (RollerCoaster Tycoon 2) game. RCT2 is an amusement park construction and management simulation computer game.
It was started in 2014 by a single person, Ted "IntelOrca" John, with the intent of modernizing upon the original game as well as porting it to other operating systems.
At the time of writing, it has 142 contributors.
The core language is C and it was painfully reverse engineered from the original game executable.

## Development Process
### Initial development
Having its roots in the hands of a single person, it probably didn't start with a specific development process. However, it was reverse engineered from the original game executable in an interesting way: a single function was re-implemented from the executable at a time and, by use of regression testing against the original game, tested to make sure it does what it's supposed to do.

### Current development
Atualmente, existem diversos colaboradores para a evolução do projeto sendo que o fundador continua a ser o maior contribuidor. Os contribuidores juntam-se numa plataforma de chat para trocar ideias sobre o jogo em si e sobre os possíveis melhorias para o jogo.

### Opinions, critics and alternatives
Put opinions, critics and alternatives about the described development process.

TODO:
	Whether the project was started with the idea of making it by himself.
	Why the project was started.
	Is there any development process?
