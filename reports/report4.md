## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Software testability is regarded as a measure of the difficulty incurred when testing a component or application. If testing is considered as not being difficult, then the testability of the software is high. If testing is considered as being a difficult process to perform, testability is considered as being lower. The main reason for seeking testability ratings is to determine early in the software development life cycle how many testing resources will be needed in order to complete the testing process. And typically, the testing process is not completed until some predefined testing stoppage criteria have been satisfied.
